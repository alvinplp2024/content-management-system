                        <li><strong>Unsupervised Learning:</strong> The algorithm identifies patterns in data without pre-labeled outcomes. Example: K-Means Clustering, PCA (Principal Component Analysis).</li>
                        <li><strong>Reinforcement Learning:</strong> The algorithm learns by interacting with its environment and receiving rewards or penalties. Example: Q-learning, Deep Q Networks.</li>
                    </ul>
                    Example of Supervised Learning:
                    <pre><code>
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
model = LinearRegression()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)  # X_train and y_train are the training data
predictions = model.predict(X_test)  # Predict using the model
                    </code></pre>
                </p>

                <p><strong>Data Preprocessing</strong><br>
                    Data preprocessing is a critical step in any machine learning pipeline, as raw data often contains noise, errors, or irrelevant features. Key preprocessing steps include:
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Handling Missing Data:</strong> Missing values can be filled using strategies like mean, median imputation or using algorithms that handle missing data.</li>
                        <li><strong>Feature Scaling:</strong> Normalize or standardize features so that the model can interpret them effectively, especially for algorithms like SVM and KNN.</li>
                        <li><strong>Encoding Categorical Data:</strong> Convert categorical variables into numerical values using techniques like One-Hot Encoding or Label Encoding.</li>
                    </ul>
                    Example of data preprocessing with scikit-learn:
                    <pre><code>
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
scaler = StandardScaler()
X_scaled = scaler.fit_transform(X)  # Standardize features
                    </code></pre>
                </p>

                <p><strong>Supervised Learning Algorithms</strong><br>
                    Supervised learning involves learning from labeled data to make predictions. Common algorithms include:

                    </ul>
                    Example of using a Decision Tree classifier:
                    <pre><code>
from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier
clf = DecisionTreeClassifier()
clf.fit(X_train, y_train)
y_pred = clf.predict(X_test)
                    </code></pre>
                </p>

                <p><strong>Unsupervised Learning Algorithms</strong><br>
                    Unsupervised learning focuses on finding hidden patterns or intrinsic structures in input data. Common algorithms include:
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>K-Means Clustering:</strong> A method of vector quantization that groups data into clusters based on feature similarity.</li>
                        <li><strong>Hierarchical Clustering:</strong> A method of cluster analysis that builds a hierarchy of clusters.</li>

                    </ul>
                    Example of K-Means clustering in Python:
                    <pre><code>
from sklearn.cluster import KMeans
kmeans = KMeans(n_clusters=3)
kmeans.fit(X)
labels = kmeans.predict(X)
                    </code></pre>
                </p>

                <p><strong>Deep Learning</strong><br>
                    Deep learning is a subset of machine learning that uses neural networks with many layers to model complex patterns in large datasets. Key topics in deep learning include:
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Neural Networks:</strong> A network of layers of neurons that can be trained to recognize patterns in data.</li>
                        <li><strong>Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs):</strong> Specialized neural networks for processing grid-like data such as images.</li>
                        <li><strong>Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs):</strong> Networks designed for sequential data, used in tasks such as speech recognition and natural language processing.</li>
                    </ul>
                    Example of defining a simple neural network in TensorFlow:
                    <pre><code>
import tensorflow as tf
model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(64, activation='relu', input_shape=(X_train.shape[1],)),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')
])
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='binary_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])
model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=10)
                    </code></pre>
                </p>

                <p><strong>Model Evaluation</strong><br>
                    Evaluating the performance of machine learning models is crucial for ensuring that they generalize well to new, unseen data. Common evaluation metrics include:
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Accuracy:</strong> The proportion of correctly classified instances out of all instances.</li>
                        <li><strong>Precision and Recall:</strong> Precision measures the accuracy of positive predictions, while recall measures the ability to find all relevant instances.</li>
                        <li><strong>F1-Score:</strong> The harmonic mean of precision and recall, providing a balance between the two metrics.</li>
                        <li><strong>Confusion Matrix:</strong> A table used to describe the performance of a classification algorithm.</li>
                    </ul>
                    Example of evaluating a model:
                    <pre><code>
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score
accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)
print(f'Accuracy: {accuracy * 100}%')
                    </code></pre>
                </p>

                <p><strong>Reinforcement Learning</strong><br>
                    Reinforcement Learning (RL) is a type of machine learning where an agent learns to make decisions by interacting with its environment and receiving feedback. Key concepts include:
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Agent:</strong> The learner or decision maker.</li>
                        <li><strong>Environment:</strong> The surroundings with which the agent interacts.</li>
                        <li><strong>Rewards:</strong> Feedback that the agent receives based on its actions.</li>
                    </ul>
                    Example of reinforcement learning:
                    <pre><code>
import numpy as np
q_table = np.zeros((state_space, action_space))
# Update the Q-table with Q-learning formula after taking actions and receiving rewards.
                    </code></pre>
                </p>

                <p><strong>Final Project</strong><br>
                    The final project involves implementing an end-to-end machine learning application. Example projects include:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Building a recommendation system using collaborative filtering and matrix factorization techniques.</li>
                        <li>Creating a sentiment analysis model for social media posts using NLP techniques.</li>
                        <li>Developing an image classification system using deep learning models like CNN.</li>
                    </ul>
                    The project will be evaluated on the application of the ML techniques, model performance, and practical implementation.
